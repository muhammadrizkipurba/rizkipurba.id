        Hello everyone, Welcome to my website!
        <br />I am Muhammad Rizki Purba. But you can just call me Rizki. I have
        known programming since I was in high school around 2012, because of my
        hobby is using the internet, made me could see the development of
        websites on the internet. That makes me even more curious about how to
        create an attractive and interactive website.
      </p>
      <p className="lh-short mb-0" style={{ color: "#7d7d7d" }}>
        I am Willing to learn the new kind of technology in web development to
        improve, and obtain the necessary skills in order to become a good
        developer. I always confident with my self-capabilities. Because in my
        opinion, the good developers are not determined by what degree they
        have, but they are determined by what skills are they mastered and
        extent to which of those skills can be implemented into real work
        projects.
